# UART Peripheral Testbench

## Overview

This directory contains a SoC-level UART integration testbench, not a standalone UART unit test.

## Files

- `TB_SOC_UART_FULL.v` (main testbench)

Note: file names are case-sensitive on Linux. Use `TB_SOC_UART_FULL.v` (not `tb_soc_uart_full.v`).

## Testbench Coverage

- RISC-V CPU and UART integration over AXI bus transactions
- Simulated instruction/data memory behavior
- Firmware loading from generated or external HEX files
- Virtual serial monitor decoding UART TX output

## Key Capabilities

1. **Dynamic firmware generation**
   - Converts text payloads (for example, "Ola Mundo") into RISC-V machine words
   - Initializes simulated RAM
   - Emits `firmware.hex` for debug and replay

2. **External HEX program loading**
   - Runs prebuilt firmware images produced outside this testbench

3. **AXI memory model behavior**
   - Serves instruction fetch reads from the simulated memory subsystem

4. **UART TX monitor**
   - Reconstructs outgoing bytes from TX signaling
   - Prints decoded output to simulator console

## Running the Local Testbench

```bash
cd design/rtl/periph/uart
iverilog -g2012 -o tb_uart.vvp TB_SOC_UART_FULL.v
vvp tb_uart.vvp
```

If your setup requires external RTL dependencies, add the required source files and include directories (`-I...`) to the compile command.
